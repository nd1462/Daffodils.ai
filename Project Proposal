Project Title: Daffodils.ai
Project Description:

Daffodils.ai is a poetry generator tool which will use Recurrent Neural Networks and Markov chains
to generate new poems which will be in the writing pattern of a particular author whose various
poems will be fed to the model as an input. Markov chains will be used to build the new sentences
and the RNN(Recurrent Neural Network) will be used to predict the various properties (syllables,
styles, rhyme scheme etc.) of the subsequent lines of the poems which in turn will ensure that the
appropriate new sentences are selected which were generated using the Markovify functions.

The data in the form of various poems of certain authors will be fed as an input to generate various
poems, which is readily available at kaggle and various other sites.

Future Prospects and Challenges:
The approach stated above will do a better job to
produce the rhyming poems, also it will be able to effectively produce the rap songs, but the major
challenge will be posed in form of generating meaningful and logical poems and in turn limits of
project will be pushed further to generate logical and unique poems as well as stories.
